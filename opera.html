    <h2>Thespis</h2>

    <h4> [Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
        Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
        ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
        columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
        stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
        should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
        ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
        mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
        clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
        duty as fatigued with their night's work]</h4>

        A great big moon is always flaring.</p>
 
        <p class = "directions">[During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
    wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
    respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
    chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
    in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.</p>

   <p class = "speech">Ugh. How cold the nights are.
        I don't know how it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
        used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. </p>

   <p>I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
